# EMODa

This repository contains the test dataset that was used to evaluate the EMODa model, found here: https://huggingface.co/NikolajMunch/danish-emotion-classification. 
Furthermore the 2 data processing apps are available to download.*



*The two web-applications are yet to be hosted online. In the meantime they can be hosted locally by typing 'streamlit run filename.py' in the terminal. Please note that the web-applications are built around the CSV-files that Meltwater outputs, so uploading a custom CSV, requires some alteration to the python script.

This is currently being worked on, to make the data applications available online and with all types of csv encodings and column names. In the meantime remember the script will have to be altered locally to adapt to other dataframes. Remember to install requirements like streamlit and the transformers library


This repo will be updated with TSV file examples, so anyone can try out the Google Embeddings Projector on Danish text with emotion labels.
