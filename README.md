# EMODa

The two web-applications are yet to be hosted online. In the meantime they can be hosted locally by typing 'streamlit run filename.py' in the terminal.

Please note that the web-applications are built around the CSV-files that Meltwater outputs, so uploading a custom CSV, requires some alteration to the python script.
This is currently being worked on, to make the data applications available online and with all types of csv encodings and column names. In the meantime remember to install requirements like streamlit and the transformers library
